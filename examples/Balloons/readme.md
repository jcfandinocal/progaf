## Game Setup
Balls can be played using different game setups:

 - Selfie Configuration: play balloons using your computer or laptop. You only need the camera looking at you, preferably located on top of the screen (but not required). In this configuration, you will pop balloons using your hands. No alignment is required.
 - Front Configuration: for this configuration, you need a computer, a projector and a depth camera. Adjust the projector to display the image over a vertical surface using a ceiling mount. Install the camera on top (or bottom part) of the projector, making sure the projected area is inside the camera field of view. Then, use the alignment tool included with PROGAF, to align projector and camera, calibrate the camera, calculate the projection matrix and you are ready to play! Use colour softballs to pop balloons. Each player can use a different color.
