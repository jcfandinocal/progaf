## PyGame Examples

- **Balloons** is a simple but funny balloons popping game, with colorful graphics, cute animations and several stages, modes, difficulties and backgrounds! Be aware of unexpected objects... they will increase your score but, of course, only when you hit them! Keep adults and kids entertained! Play balloons using your computer or laptop. You only need a USB camera looking at you, preferably located on top of the screen (but not required). Pop balloons using your hands. Enjoy!


- **HandPong** is a combination of classic 'pong' and 'breakout', adding some state-of-the-art computer vision software! Use both hands or, better, invite someone to play with you!
