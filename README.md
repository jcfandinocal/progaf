# Projection Games Framework

[PROGAF](https://www.progaf.org) (Projection Games Framework) is a software framework to support development of games and other applications using projection mapping (also known as surface projection, video mapping or spatial augmented reality) and/or real world object tracking using cameras. Expected uses for the framework include the development of games and possibly other applications across several domains including education, training, marketing, exhibition, entertainment and art.

The goal of the project is to provide a light, conceptually clean, open source framework to support application development. Main features ares:
- Easy and intuitive projector-camera alignment and calibration
- Real world objects detection, identification and tracking
- Projection mapping over static surfaces and/or moving objects in real time
- Object oriented abstraction layer to support hardware, detected objects, gestures and events
- Capabilities to render/project in real time any combination of video streams, images, textures, text or graphics
- Integration with other frameworks / game engines (pygame, panda3D, ...)
